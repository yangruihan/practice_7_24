Higher_Level Concepts

There are several stacks, such as common, common_msgs, and geometry, that provide these higher-level concepts for use with ROS and are described below.

1.Coordinate Frames/Transforms
	The tf package provides a distributed(分布式), ROS-based framework for calculating the positions of multiple coordinate(协调) frames over time.

2.Actions/Tasks
	The actionlib package defines a common, topic-based interface for preemptible(抢占) tasks in ROS.

3. Message 
	The common_msgs stack provide a base message ontology(消息体) for robotic systems. It defines several classes of messages, including:

		actionlib_msgs:messages for representing actions.
		diagnostic_msgs:messages for sending diagnostic(诊断) data.
		geometry_msgs:messages for representing common geometric primitives(几何图元).
		nav_msgs:messages for navigation(导航).
		sensor_msgs:messages for representing sensor data.

4.Plugins
	pluginlib provides a library for dynamically loading libraries in C++ code.

5.Filters
	The filters package provides a C++ library for processing data using a sequence of filters.

6.Robot Model
	The urdf package defines an XML format for representing a robot model and provides a C++ parser(解析器).

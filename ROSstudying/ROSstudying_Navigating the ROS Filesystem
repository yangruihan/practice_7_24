# Filesystem Tools
	
	# Using rospack
	rospack allows you to get information about packages.
		
		* rospack find [package_name] 
		(return the path to package)
		* example:
			$ rospack find roscpp
			return:
			/opt/ros/hydro/share/roscpp
			
	# Using roscd
	roscd is part of the rosbash suite. It allows you to change directory (cd) directly to a package or a stack. 
	
		* roscd [locationname[/subdir]]
		* example:
			$ roscd roscpp
			$ pwd
			return:
			/opt/ros/hydro/share/roscpp
			
	# roscd log
	roscd log will take you to the folder where ROS stores log files.
	
	# Using rosls
	rosls is part of the rosbash suite. It allows you to ls directly in a package by name rather than by absolute path.
	
		* rosls [locationname[/subdir]
		* example:
			$ rosls roscpp_tutorials
			return:
			cmake  package.xml  srv
			
	# Tab Completion
	like Linux command-line, TAB can help you to complete an entire package name.
		
		* example:
			roscd roscpp_tut<<< now push the TAB key>>>
			After pushing the TAB key, the command line should fill out the rest:
			roscd roscpp_tutorials/
			
			
# You may have noticed a pattern with the naming of the ROS tools:
	
	rospack = ros + pack(age)
	roscd = ros + cd
	rosls = ros + ls
